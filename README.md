# planks

A web components library built plank by plank. Forked from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and gradually transforming into framework-agnostic web components.

## About

Planks is a hard fork of shadcn/ui with a different goal: to provide the same beautifully designed components as web components that work anywhere - React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS, or any framework.

Like the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), we're replacing each React component plank by plank until we have something entirely new.

## Status

This project is in early development. We're actively replacing React components with web components.
