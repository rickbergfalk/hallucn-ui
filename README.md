# planks

A web components library built plank by plank. Forked from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and gradually transforming into framework-agnostic web components.

Like the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), we're replacing each React component plank by plank until we have something entirely new.

## Tech Choices

| Choice | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Lit** | Lightweight, fast, great DX with decorators and reactive properties |
| **Light DOM** | Tailwind classes apply directly - no shadow DOM styling headaches |
| **Tailwind required** | Components emit Tailwind classes; consumers provide Tailwind in their build |
| **Test-driven** | React components are the spec; visual snapshot tests ensure pixel parity |

## Structure
